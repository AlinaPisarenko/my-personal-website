      <h3>I'm a Web developer based in New York</h3>
      <p>
        Here is my story how I got into coding. I studied design and
        architecture at the State Technical University of Saratov. During last
        couple of years in school and after graduating, I was working as an
        interior designer. But I always had a dream about moving to another
        country, so in 2016 I moved to New York and I have been bartending since
        then. I've been interested in tech since the first year of my college,
        but only recently I realized that this is what I want to do for life, so
        I have been teaching myself via Shecodes, Codeacademy and Udemy. I think
        of myself as a goal-oriented person who is easy to work with, a
        team-player, who can also work independently. Studying and working in
        architecture helped me become an organized and patient worker, while my
        bartending experience gave me the ability to work well under pressure
        and be able to start any conversation easily. I am committed to learning
        and self-development so that I can consistently achieve better results.
        I look forward to every single challenge coding will bring me. Just like
        architecture, an art that used by people daily, coding will let me
        create something that people will use, work and interact with on a daily
        basis. And I feel really excited about it!
