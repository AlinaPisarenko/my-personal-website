      <h3>I'm a Web developer based in New York</h3>
      <p>
        Originally I'm from Russia. I studied design and architecture at the
        State Technical University of Saratov. During last couple of years in
        school and after graduating, I was working as an interior designer. But
        I always had a dream about moving to another country, so in 2016 I moved
        to New York and I have been bartending since then. I've been interested
        in tech since the first year of my college, but only recently I realized
        that this is what I want to do for life, so I have been teaching myself
        via Shecodes, Codeacademy and Udemy. I think of myself as a
        goal-oriented person who is easy to work with, a team-player, who can
        also work independently. Studying and working in architecture helped me
        become an organized and patient worker, while my bartending experience
        gave me the ability to work well under pressure and be able to start any
        conversation easily. I am committed to learning and self-development so
        that I can consistently achieve better results. I look forward to every
        single challenge coding will bring me. Just like architecture, an art
        that used by people daily, coding will let me create something that
        people will use, work and interact with on a daily basis. And I feel
        really excited about it!
